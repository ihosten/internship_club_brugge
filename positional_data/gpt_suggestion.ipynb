    "- type 1: COD could occur both when the player starts from a static or semi-static position and must move into a different direction (does not involve deceleration)\n",
    "- type 2: advances in a certain direction prior to having to maneuver into a new direction (does often involve deceleration)\n",
    "- Type 3: a change in the initial path without changing the direction that the player is facing with a combination of linear (backwards or forward) and lateral movements (does always involve deceleration)\n",
